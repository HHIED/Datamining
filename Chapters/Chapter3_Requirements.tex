This chapter covers the details of the functional and non-functional requirements of the product and how these were derived.

\section{Requirements engineering}
The requirements of the project are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements were derived from the original case (Appendix \ref{Case}), continuously planned meetings with \gls{Struct}, and as a part of the constant research done during the project. \\
The functionality of the final product fulfills the most important aspects of the case, and the requirements derived from the client meetings.

\subsection{Functional requirements} 
The most important features of the system includes delivery of quality product recommendations and handling of new data. These are very complex features and several requirements must be fulfilled in order to realize them. The functional requirements can be seen in table \ref{table:functionalrequirements}. These requirements have been the driving force throughout the project.

\end{table}

As seen in table \ref{table:functionalrequirements}, the final product consists of 15 functional requirements. This corresponds with the wish of a simple \gls{API}, that provides good quality product recommendations. F01 - \textit{provide recommendations}, was the most important requirement and has therefore acted as an ongoing task during the entire development of the product. F02-F15 are secondary requirements and not crucial before the recommendation algorithm was implemented. Once the algorithm is developed, the remaining functional requirements are needed to keep the data updated.

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
The non-functional requirements can be seen in table \ref{table:nonfunctionalrequirements}.

Few non-functional requirements were discovered, but these are challenging to accommodate. The platform \gls{Struct} use as the main tool for developing is based on the programming language C\#. NF01 - \textit{Programming language and platform} was derived as a result of this. \gls{aspnet} was chosen because of its high performance and scalable systems, which was needed to realize NF02 - \textit{Efficiency} \cite{NetCore}.
NF02 was probably the most challenging requirement to fulfill, however very important since a fast responding website is imperative. \gls{Struct} wished for a new database for recommendation data, able to scale up to billions of records. A \gls{NoSQL} database was the right approach because of its outward scalability \cite{NoSQLScalability}. This resulted in requirement NF03 - \textit{Scalability}. The \gls{API} had to be easily accessible and the data output had to be in a standardized format, in order to lower the amount of effort needed to integrate the recommendation system. This resulted in requirement NF04 - \textit{Accessibility}.\\
The functional and non-functional requirements are used throughout the project to analyze, design, implement and test the system. An analysis of the requirements provides an overview and better conceptual understanding of the system.
