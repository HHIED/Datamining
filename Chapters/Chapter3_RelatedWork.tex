\section{State of the art}

Datamining, webshop development and product recommendation algorithms is all something that has been around for quite some time now. There has, therefore, been a big variety of inspiration sources for this project. In order to achieve the best possible result, some of the most successful developers of recommendation algorithms was investigated. The video streaming service, Netflix, have invested a lot of resources in coming up with the best possible recommendation algorithm.\cite{Netflix} This includes a worldwide competition for \$1 million, called the Netflix Prize. \cite{NetflixPrize} Netflix can definitively be considered state of the art in the video streaming field. Another company who has had huge success with its recommendation, is the online retail giant Amazon. For years, Amazon has had increasing sales due to their product recommendation system.\cite{AmazonSuccess} What these two giants have in common, is that they are both using a collaborative recommendation algorithm. This is also the reason why the recommendation algorithm of this project is developed with the same technique, and will be elaborated further in \ref{Chapter5}. Since the environment of the project, is mostly similar to the environment of Amazon, this has been the greatest source of inspiration. 


\section{Amazon}
As mentioned before, Amazon has achieved great success with their recommendation system. There are many different techniques to develop a good product recommendation algorithm, but to develop one that is both smart, efficient and increases sale can be a difficult task. Some of the most common methods are user-to-user collaborative filtering, clustering and item-to-item collaborative filtering. Amazon's recommendation system is based on the latter, due to its fast pace response and precise recommendations. When developing a user-to-user collaborative filtering algorithm you tend to end up with a precise, but slow recommendation system. By developing a clustering system, the response time can be very fast, but the quality of the recommendation will not be good. \cite{AmazonRecommendations} Other recommendation systems have been developed, but Amazon come out as one of the greatest successors in the business and their recommendation system is one of their strong assets.
